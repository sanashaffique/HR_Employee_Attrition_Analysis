HR Employee Attrition Analysis

Project Overview:
This project analyzes the HR Employee Attrition dataset from Kaggle, containing 1,470 records and 34 features. The objective is to examine employee attrition trends across departments, gender, job roles, salaries, and other key factors, and to identify drivers of attrition and factors contributing to employee retention. This analysis demonstrates the ability to combine Python, SQL, and Power BI for actionable insights.

Project Motivation:
Employee attrition is a critical challenge for organizations, impacting productivity, costs, and team morale. By analyzing patterns and key factors that contribute to attrition, organizations can implement data-driven strategies to retain top talent and optimize HR policies.

Tools & Technologies:
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn) – Data cleaning, transformation, visualization
SQL – Querying and aggregating HR data
Power BI – Interactive dashboards and visual insights
Excel – Data verification and preprocessing

Dataset Details:

Interactive Visualizations: Overall attrition, department-wise trends, salary distribution, employee satisfaction
Enables quick insights for stakeholders

Key Insights:
Middle-aged employees show the highest attrition; older employees show greater loyalty
R&D department has the highest attrition; HR has the lowest
Low-income employees (<$5,000) are at highest risk of leaving
Sales Executives and Lab Technicians have highest attrition despite some high satisfaction scores
Managers and Research Directors maintain long tenure and high satisfaction

Recommendations:
Investigate high-turnover roles (Sales & R&D) to identify pain points
Review compensation and benefits for low-income employees
Collect qualitative feedback for hidden job dissatisfaction
Develop targeted retention strategies for middle-aged and high-turnover groups
Ensure training programs contribute to measurable career growth
